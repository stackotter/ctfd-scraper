# CTFd Scraper

This fork updates the scraper to python3 and changes the format to suit my liking. It also gives the
code a general clean up.

## Usage

```sh
# Provide username and password in command
python ctfd_scraper.py [url] [out_dir] --username [username] --password [password]
```

## Dependencies

```sh
pip install requests json beautifulsoup4 clean-text unidecode
```
